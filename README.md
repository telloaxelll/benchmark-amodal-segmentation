# Benchmarking U-NET and Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) for Amodal Image Segmentation

## Introduction: 
This GitHub repository is established to continue researching, benchmarking, and analyzing U-NET and NCA architectures for amodal image 
segmentation. This repository will attempt to establish baselines between both architectures, and provide metrics for evaluating machine 
learning models using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

### Author Notes: 
This research is ongoing alongside other members of the team such as: Melanie Bustos-Gomez, Wesley Hur, Eduardo Lizarzaburu.
